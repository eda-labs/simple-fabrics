# These are global status color buckets which overlays can use.  When displayed, these buckets will map to
# colors.  The specific colors may change from user to user so these buckets need to be defined more
# generically.
#
# First, there are 10 levels of good to bad where level 9 is the best and level 0 is the worst.  A common
# visualization would maybe map level 9 to green and level 0 to red.  Perhaps the other levels in between
# 9 and 0 use shades or dashed visualizations to indicate "not entirely good" or "not entirely bad".
# Think about a utilization overlay where you could have buckets for 0% to 10% utilized, 10% to 20% utilized,
# etc.
#
# Because overlays will commonly have binary or trinary states where things are either good/bad or
# maybe good/recovering/bad, we also define three constants for best, medium and worst which just map
# to the other buckets.
#
# Finally, we define 6 other arbitrary state buckets.  These are for states which are not inherently
# on a scale from good to bad.  Instead, each of these states are just independent of each other.  When
# visualized, we would tend to use distinct hues to tell them apart rather than some kind of gradation
# between them.
#
# Applications do not and should not try to use all of these states in their overlays.  Use what you
# need.  The UI will use the information it has to try to build a good color visualization at runtime
# based on the kind of statuses you say you will be returning.
